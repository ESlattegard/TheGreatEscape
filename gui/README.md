# The Great Escape/GUI
## TODO:
#### GUI
- Up arrow is upload right now, replace with button later
- Remove move player with right arrow, but keep the mechanics
- Determine if PNG is to large or small
- Represent player as a drawn circle instead of a png? Better scaling
- Figure out how to make click/hover buttons and how to view different tabs
- Create test matrix run file with a player moving, and figure out how to step through it graphically/run it in some speed
- Think about layering (player movement, fire, smoke)
- Place players in python? Randomize on white surface. If not enough pixels for number of people, throw error.
